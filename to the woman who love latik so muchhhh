A sun that shines beautifully has no match against your radiance and beauty.
Your smile is the causation of my happiness, my only cure for frowning.
without your presence, there's no light, and when there's no light, there is darkness, darkness makes me sad.
If only we have the power to free ourselves from the restraints of life and unfairness, I would've made you mine forever.
You will always be in my mind everyday, I will always miss you and your everything. 
I hope I'm also in your mind everyday, I hope you will always miss me and my everything.
My love for you will never die.
